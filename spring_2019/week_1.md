## Last Week's Accomplishments


> This past week, I was learning javascript and node js.
> I tried to use JavaScript to make a register template.

## This Week's Plan


> Read some code written by students in last semester and continue making register form. \


## Anything Blocking?


> Not sure about details of the form's design. I will talk with other group members.
